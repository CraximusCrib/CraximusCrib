		<p><a href="https://craximuscrib.bandcamp.com/">Craximus Crib</a> is Ben Cottier, Clay Schreiber and Rohan Osbourne. Formed in the dank depths of the musical den known as the Fish Bowl, they bring a fresh sound to the shit beats scene. Indeed, their debut EP boldly beared this name. Shit Beats was a revelation at a time when the genre was well and truly becoming stale. The boys are now gearing up for a fresh release. Though Shit Beats 2 continues to deliver "some of the shittest beats I know" (Craximus, 2014), the boys have undeniably stepped up their beat game. Stay tuned for what will undoubtedly be the hottest tape to drop this summer.</p>
		

		<h2>Origins</h2>
		
		<img src="images/Gawthorpe_Hall,_Burnley,_Lancashire.jpg" alt="The Craximus Estate, commonly known as Craximus Crib">
		
		<p>Craximus Crib is the nickname of Great Uncle Craximus' extravagant estate. For those who don't know, Craximus is the Great Uncle of Benjo Bear, half of the notorious rap duo Classic Clay and the Gang. The boys took inspiration from this magnificent mansion and its famous residents in their search for fresh beats.</p>
		
		
		<h2> Discography </h2>
		
		<h3>Anal Beats (2014)</h3>

		<p>Anal Beats was the debut single for the Crib. Controversial at first, it quickly won over newcomers and veteran beat-makers alike, and redefined the genre. In retrospect this is no surprise, with its rapid switch-up of beats through the course of the track always keeping you guessing, and the ingenius use of brass and didgeridoo synth. Critics raved:</p>
		
		<p>"These beats are wack but they got a strange appeal." - Benjo Bear</p>
		<p>"What is this shit?" - Great Uncle Craximus</p>
		<p>"What a meme." - Anonymous</p>
